										<h1>Assessing A Mental Health Support Embedded In Tumblr</h1>

									<div class="box">
										<p><b>Study Rationale</b>: Digital mental health tools have long been proposed as one way to provide accessible support; however, few effective supports are publicly available, and user engagement is notoriously low in real-world settings. I triangulated across multiple user research methods (e.g., quantitative and qualitative survey data, analytics) to understand whether three brief supports could be integrated within Tumblr’s search function to better engage users and improve mental health at-scale.</p>
										<p><b>Research Question</b>: How do users engage with, and feel about, brief mental health supports offered in this online context? Do users report changes in mental health outcomes from before to after completing each support?</p>
										<p><b>Findings & Recommendations</b>: The three Tumblr-embedded supports observed >13 times the number of click-throughs and twice the completion rate as other effective digital mental health supports tested in real-world settings. Although users felt positively about the supports on average, some users felt dismissed by specific language choices. Churn was highest during free-response writing exercises. In line with previous A/B testing, hopelessness and self-hate decreased from before to after completing a support. I recommended continued rollout of these embedded supports—prioritizing language edits to better validate users and streamlined free-response exercises to minimize churn.</p>

												<h4>Method: Qualitative and quantitative survey data, analytics</h4>
											</header>
											<p>6,179 Tumblr users searching for key mental health terms (e.g., “self-harm”, "$uicide") were presented with an in-app overlay of crisis resources and direct messaged with the three brief, digital mental health supports. Questionnaires measured mental health outcomes before and after completing each digital support. After completing a support, users provided qualitative and quantitative feedback with an open-ended survey item (“Do you have any feedback for us?”) and star ratings (1-5 stars). I assessed views, click-throughs, completion rates, and churn patterns for each support.</p>

											<h4>Insight #1: Tailored support</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Users appreciated personalized components within each support, and wanted more (see qualitative user feedback):</p>
										<blockquote>User: "I liked that it was personalized, I wish it happened more."</blockquote>										
										<p>Recommendation: Incorporate interactive components into embedded supports where possible.

											<h4>Insight #2: Dismissive language</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Language designed to be encouraging may be perceived as dismissive (see qualitative user feedback):</p>
										<blockquote>User: “at times, it makes change seem too easy. change is a hard and not that simple”</blockquote>										
										<p>Recommendation: Edit copy to emphasize that change is a process that happens over time, while also highlighting some value in incremental, short-term changes.

											<h4>Insight #3: High user ratings</h4>
										</header>
										<p>On average, users rated all three supports highly (4.2-4.3 out of 5 stars).</p>
										<p>Recommendation: Continue to offer brief support options within Tumblr.</p>	
										<p>Recommendation: Evaluate whether making recommended iterations improves ratings.</p>

											<h4>Insight #4: Polarizing free-response activities</h4>
										</header>
										<p>While some users wrote lengthy replies to free-response activities, many may have felt fatigued (see qualitative survey feedback, churn data):</p>
										<blockquote>User: “i would like more of these. less writing tho.”</blockquote>
										<div class="box">
											<i>Some users responded with 1-2 paragraphs of text. However, churn rate peaked on free-response pages (~5-15% user attrition; see yellow highlights in figure).</i>
										</div>
										<p>Recommendation 1: Conduct interviews with users to understand why people like or dislike free-responses activities.</p>	
										<p>Recommendation 2: Limit free-response activities to reduce overall churn.</p>
										<p>Recommendation 3: Provide multiple-choice items where possible, with a “say more” option for users who want to write.</p>

											<h4>Insight #5: Users will engage</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Users may more readily engage with, and complete, supports that are brief and embedded into online social platforms (see click-throughs and completion rates):</p>
										<div class = "box">
											<i>Click-throughs and completion rates for Tumblr-embedded supports were dramatically higher (>13x and 2x, respectively), relative to longer digital supports not embedded in Tumblr.</i>
										</div>
										<p>Recommendation: Continue to develop and offer brief and embedded supports, as they are likely to reach more people than existing alternatives.

											<h4>Insight #6: Very brief supports are likely helpful</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Abbreviating digital supports for this embedded context may not lessen their effectiveness (see regresion analyses):</p>
										<div class = "box">
											<i>Regression analyses found significant decreases in hopelessness and self-hate from before to after support completion (all ps < .001). Effect sizes for change in mental health outcomes were comparable to large-scale A/B test evaluations of longer supports (dz hopelessness = .71 vs .81; dz self-hate = .61 vs .67 for full-length and abbreviated SSIs, respectively).</i>
										</div>
										<p>Recommendation: Continue to offer/develop brief supports, as they likely improve mental health outcomes.
