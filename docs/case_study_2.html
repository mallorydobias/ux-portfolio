										<h1>Testing an Online Support for Teens with Recent Self-Harm</h1>

										<span class="image main"><img src="images/study_flow.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<div class="box">
										<p><b>Study Rationale</b>: Many teenagers do not access formal or consistent mental health treatment for self-harm, and a majority seek out information or help for their mental health online. I evaluated whether one online resource, “Project SAVE”, could help teenage users (1) reduce their self-harm behaviors, and (2) feel better about themselves. I designed and conducted an A/B test, administering surveys to understand changes in self-hatred and self-harm over time.</p>
										<p><b>Research Question</b>: Can this online support tool help teenagers reduce how frequently they harm themselves? Can it help reduce self-hate?</p>
										<p><b>Findings & Recommendations</b>: The Project SAVE support tool did not reduce teenagers’ self-harm behavior three months later. Right after Project SAVE, teenagers reported reductions in self-hatred. There was clear demand for anonymous mental health resources for self-harm among teens, backed by qualitative feedback and high completion rates. I recommended integrating a streamlined Project SAVE in online communities of teenagers experiencing self-harm and self-hate, who likely do not have timely access to other supports.</p>

												<h4>Method: A/B testing</h4>
											</header>
											<p>565 teenagers with a recent history of self-harm were randomly assigned to one of two, time-matched versions of an online support tool: one providing standard supportive care, and one teaching specific strategies to manage self-harm urges (Project SAVE). Questionnaires assessed self-hatred and desire to stop self-harm behavior immediately before and after each of the two tools. Teenagers provided written qualitative (“What would you change about the program?”) and quantitative feedback (Likert scales) on both tools. 3 months later, teenagers from both groups received questionnaires about self-harm. I used <a href="https://osf.io/x5cd9">pre-registered</a> intent-to-treat analyses with multiple imputation to minimize the impact of missing data on results.</p>

											<h4>Insight #1: Decreased self-hatred</h4>
										</header>
										<p>SAVE decreased teenagers’ self-hatred, relative to those assigned to standard supportive care:</p>
										<div class="box">
										<i>Intent-to-treat regression analyses detected significant differences between SAVE and standard supportive care groups (p < .001, d = -.35), controlling for teenagers’ pre-test values. Results remained consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses.</i>
										</div>										
										<p>Recommendation: Integrate SAVE into online settings where quick, short-term improvements in self-hate are especially valuable (e.g., intercepting users seeking information about self-hate or self-harm online).

										<p>SAVE did not reduce self-harm 3 months later, relative to those assigned to standard supportive care:</p>

											<h4>Insight #3: High completion rate</h4>

										<p>A majority of teenagers who started SAVE (80%) finished the entire program.</p>

											<h4>Insight #4: Demand for anonymous supports</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Teenagers liked that the support was anonymous (see qualitative survey feedback):</p>
										<blockquote>User 1: “I really like how it feels safe and anonymous. It makes me feel comfortable to answer honestly.”</blockquote>
										<blockquote>User 2: “The questions gave me a way to express things I’m too afraid to tell other people. It made me a little happy knowing someone cares.”</blockquote>
										<p>Recommendation: Continue to develop, evaluate, and disseminate anonymous mental health support options to teens who may be dealing with self-harm.

											<h4>Insight #5: Demand for shorter support</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Teenagers wished the tool was shorter (see qualitative survey feedback):</p>
										<blockquote>User 3: “It was kinda long. For kids with adhd like myself, its hard to focus... The illustrations really helped bring my focus together and make sure i don't zone out.”</blockquote>
										<p>Recommendation: Streamline SAVE to remove redundant content and prevent churn.
