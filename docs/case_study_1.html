										<h1>Evaluating A Mental Health Peer Support Tool For Discord</h1>
									</header>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/discord2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<div class="box">
										<p><b>Study Rationale</b>: Analyses of user onboarding patterns showed high churn rates between setup and activation of a Discord-based mental health peer support tool. I conducted user interviews and usability testing with Discord server moderators (“mods”) to understand reasons for user churn, identify common pain points, and develop recommendations for future product iterations. </p>
										<p><b>Research Question</b>: Why are mods not completing the onboarding process to install this peer support service in their servers?</p>
										<p><b>Findings & Recommendations</b>: Mods were not understanding the product’s value proposition or functionality as they progressed through onboarding. This included confusion about whether the tool’s ‘peer-support’ involves connecting with other people, as well as uncertainty about how their posts would be shared (and with whom). I recommended editing the tool’s webpage and streamlining onboarding copy to facilitate a smoother, clearer onboarding flow.</p>

												<h4>Method: User interviews, moderated usability testing</h4>
											</header>
											<p>8 Discord users with moderation experience were recruited from Prolific for user interviews. Post-interview, each participant completed usability testing for the tool’s promotional webpage, installation, and setup.</p>

											<h4>Insight #1: Unclear landing page</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Based on the product's landing page, mods were uncertain whether ‘peer-support’ involved connecting with other people, a chatbot, or resource provision (see interview quotes):</p>
										<blockquote>User 1: “I’m surprised. I thought it would give you resources. I didn’t think it would connect you with other Discord users."</blockquote>
										<blockquote>User 2: “I'm not sure if it would have an AI that would interact with you, or if it also would be real people – this suggests it could be either.”</blockquote>
										<p>Recommendation: Edit landing page to emphasize users will be connected with real people.</p>

											<h4>Insight #2: Lengthy onboarding</h4>
										</header>
										<p> Even for mods who anticipated being connected with other people, they began to doubt this initial impression as the onboarding process continues (see interview quote):</p>
										<blockquote>User 4: “At this point, I’m not sure if it is only scripted, I mean, automated AI… is it going to connect me to someone?"</blockquote>
										<p>Recommendation 1: Streamline onboarding copy to more quickly connect users with peers.</p>
										<p>Recommendation 2: Add very brief updates (e.g., “X more steps until you’re connected with other Koko users just like you!”) to reassure users during onboarding.</p>

											<h4>Insight #3: Unclear posting functionality</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Mods were surprised that anonymous posts are shared to a public vent channel in their server (see interview quote):</p>
										<blockquote>User 3: “Oh woah, I didn’t expect for my post to go the channel. I thought it was just the DMs [direct messages]”</blockquote>
										<p>Recommendation: Before posting, ask users if they would like to share anonymously on their server's vent channel, or only through direct message to their matched peer.</p>

											<h4>Insight #4: Lots of anticipated questions</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Mods anticipated having to answer lots of questions about the tool in their servers. Some doubted whether people will use the tool altogether (see interview quote):</p>
										<blockquote>User 6: “If they’re unfamiliar with it, they probably want to know more… they may not even realize or trust that it’s anonymous. So, more information may make it more likely they’ll use it.”</blockquote>
										<p>Recommendation: Automatically add a pinned comment where users first engage with the tool (i.e., the public vent channel) to emphasize anonymity and link to FAQs.
